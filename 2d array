### **Understanding the Code Fragment in Detail**

This Java code demonstrates how a **two-dimensional (2D) array** is created dynamically, step by step. Letâ€™s analyze it thoroughly.

---

## **Step 1: Declaring the Array**
```java
int[][] multiplicationTable = new int[5][];
System.out.println("multiplicationTable = " + multiplicationTable);
```
- Here, `multiplicationTable` is declared as a **2D array**.
- **However, only the first dimension is specified (`5`)**, meaning that this array can hold **five references to other arrays**, but the second dimension (column size) is not yet defined.
- At this point, `multiplicationTable` does not contain actual integer valuesâ€”only five `null` references.

#### **Output:**
```
multiplicationTable = [[I@14991ad
```
- The notation `[[I@14991ad` indicates that this is a **2D integer array**, and `14991ad` is the memory address.

---

## **Step 2: Printing the Array Elements**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < multiplicationTable.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("multiplicationTable[" + i + "] = " + multiplicationTable[i]);
}
```
- This loop iterates through the **first dimension** (i.e., `multiplicationTable.length`, which is `5`).
- Since no actual arrays have been assigned yet, all elements are `null`.

#### **Output:**
```
multiplicationTable[0] = null
multiplicationTable[1] = null
multiplicationTable[2] = null
multiplicationTable[3] = null
multiplicationTable[4] = null
```
- This confirms that `multiplicationTable` currently contains **null references** because we have not yet allocated memory for the second dimension.

---

## **Step 3: Creating the Inner Arrays**
```java
System.out.println("\nCreate array");
for (int i = 0; i < multiplicationTable.length; i++) {
    multiplicationTable[i] = new int[5];  // Assigning a 1D array of size 5
    System.out.println("multiplicationTable[" + i + "] = " + multiplicationTable[i]);
}
```
- **Now, each row (i.e., `multiplicationTable[i]`) is assigned a new integer array of size `5`**.
- Each row is now **a separate 1D array** stored at a different memory location.

#### **Output:**
```
Create array
multiplicationTable[0] = [I@d93b30
multiplicationTable[1] = [I@16d3586
multiplicationTable[2] = [I@154617c
multiplicationTable[3] = [I@a14482
multiplicationTable[4] = [I@140e19d
```
- The notation `[I@d93b30` means:
  - `[I` â†’ An array of integers.
  - `@d93b30` â†’ Memory address of that array.

At this point, the structure looks like this:

```
multiplicationTable â†’ [ [array] [array] [array] [array] [array] ]
                         â†‘       â†‘       â†‘       â†‘       â†‘
                         |       |       |       |       |
                       [0,0,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,0] [0,0,0,0,0] ...
```
---

## **Step 4: Initializing the Array and Displaying Values**
```java
System.out.println("\nInitialization array");
for (int i = 0; i < multiplicationTable.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < multiplicationTable[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(" " + multiplicationTable[i][j]);
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```
- **This prints out the values stored in `multiplicationTable`**.
- Since arrays of integers in Java are **automatically initialized to `0`**, all elements will be `0`.

#### **Output:**
```
Initialization array
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```
- This confirms that each row in `multiplicationTable` contains **five zeroes**.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Partial Array Definition (`new int[5][]`)**
   - Only the first dimension (rows) is allocated memory initially.
   - The inner arrays (columns) are `null` at the start.

2. **Dynamic Allocation of Inner Arrays**
   - The inner arrays are **created separately in a loop**, allowing flexibility in defining the size of each row independently.

3. **Memory Addresses**
   - Printing `multiplicationTable[i]` before allocation shows `null`.
   - After allocation, it prints a unique memory address for each row.

4. **Default Values in Java Arrays**
   - All elements in a newly allocated integer array are initialized to `0`.

---

### **How is This Useful?**
- **Flexible 2D Arrays**: You can create **jagged arrays** where each row has a different number of columns.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Memory is allocated only when needed.
- **Better Understanding of References**: This demonstrates how Java stores arrays as objects in memory.
